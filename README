How to install Submit
#####################

- Download the source code distribution.
- Unpack it somehwere in a folder that your web server can access.
- Copy settings.ini.template to /etc/settings.ini and edit it according to your local needs. 
- Run "manage.py syncdb" and "manage.py migrate" to create / update the configured database.
- Configure your web server to serve Submit as WSGI application. Typically, we would expect some snippet like this inside a VirtualHost definition:

WSGIScriptAlias /submit <src_dir>/submit/wsgi.py
WSGIDaemonProcess submit
WSGIProcessGroup  submit
Alias /submit/static/admin /usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/Django-1.4.2-py2.6.egg/django/contrib/admin/static/admin
Alias /submit/static       <src_dir>/submit/static
